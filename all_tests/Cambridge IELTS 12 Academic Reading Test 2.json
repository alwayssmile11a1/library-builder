            "title": "The risks agriculture faces in developing countries",
            "passage": "<span><em>Synthesis of an online debate*</em></span><br><span><strong>A</strong></span><br><span>Two things distinguish food production from all other productive activities: first, every single person needs food each day and has a right to it; and second, it is hugely dependent on nature. These two unique aspects, one political, the other natural, make food production highly vulnerable and different from any other business. At the same time, cultural values are highly entrenched in food and agricultural systems worldwide.</span><br><span><strong>B</strong></span><br><span>Farmers everywhere face major risks, including extreme weather, long-term climate change, and price volatility in input and product markets. However, smallholder farmers in developing countries must in addition deal with adverse environments, both natural, in terms of soil quality, rainfall, etc., and human, in terms of infrastructure, financial systems, markets, knowledge and technology. Counter-intuitively, hunger is prevalent among many smallholder farmers in the developing world.</span><br><span><strong>C</strong></span><br><span>Participants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the underlying causes of the agricultural system&rsquo;s inability to ensure sufficient food for all, and they identified as drivers of this problem our dependency on fossil fuels and unsupportive government policies.</span><br><span><strong>D</strong></span><br><span>On the question of mitigating the risks farmers face, most essayists called for greater state intervention. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, argued that governments can significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get produce more efficiently to markets, or water and food storage facilities to reduce losses. Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, suggested that the procurement and holding of stocks by governments can also help mitigate wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about market supply.&nbsp;</span><br><span><strong>E</strong></span><br><span>Shenggen Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute, held up social safety nets and public welfare programmes in Ethiopia, Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among farming families and reduce their vulnerability to agriculture shocks. However, some commentators responded that cash transfers to poor families do not necessarily translate into increased food security, as these programmes do not always strengthen food production or raise incomes. Regarding state subsidies for agriculture, Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, commented in her essay that these &lsquo;have not compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private traders. In fact, studies show that sixty percent of beneficiaries of subsidies are not poor, but rich landowners and non-farmer traders.&rsquo;</span><br><span><strong>F</strong></span><br><span>Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools, like private insurance, commodity futures markets, and rural finance can help small-scale producers mitigate risk and allow for investment in improvements. Kabir warned that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high-input agricultural practices, which in the medium term may raise production costs beyond the value of their harvests. Murphy noted that when futures markets become excessively financialised they can contribute to short-term price volatility, which increases farmers&rsquo; food insecurity. Many participants and commentators emphasised that greater transparency in markets is needed to mitigate the impact of volatility, and make evident whether adequate stocks and supplies are available. Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held responsible for paying for negative side effects.</span><br><span><strong>G</strong></span><br><span>Many essayists mentioned climate change and its consequences for small-scale agriculture. Fan explained that &lsquo;in addition to reducing crop yields, climate change increases the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events, which increase smallholder vulnerability.&rsquo; The growing unpredictability of weather patterns increases farmers&rsquo; difficulty in managing weather-related risks. According to this author, one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more resilient to new climate trends and extreme weather patterns. Accordingly, Pat Mooney, co-founder and executive director of the ETC Group, suggested that &lsquo;if we are to survive climate change, we must adopt policies that let peasants diversify the plant and animal species and varieties/breeds that make up our menus.&rsquo;</span><br><span><strong>H</strong></span><br><span>Some participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community-based and autonomous risk management strategies through collective action groups, co-operatives or producers&rsquo; groups. Such groups enhance market opportunities for small-scale producers, reduce marketing costs and synchronise buying and selling with seasonal price conditions. According to Murphy, &lsquo;collective action offers an important way for farmers to strengthen their political and economic bargaining power, and to reduce their business risks.&rsquo; One commentator, Giel Ton, warned that collective action does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort and money to organise, build trust and to experiment. Others, like Marcel Vernooij and Marcel Beukeboom, suggested that in order to &lsquo;apply what we already know&rsquo;, all stakeholders, including business, government, scientists and civil society, must work together, starting at the beginning of the value chain.</span><br><span><strong>I</strong></span><br><span>Some participants explained that market price volatility is often worsened by the presence of intermediary purchasers who, taking advantage of farmers&rsquo; vulnerability, dictate prices. One commentator suggested farmers can gain greater control over prices and minimise price volatility by selling directly to consumers. Similarly, Sonali Bisht, founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education (INHERE), India, wrote that community-supported agriculture, where consumers invest in local farmers by subscription and guarantee producers a fair price, is a risk-sharing model worth more attention. Direct food distribution systems not only encourage small-scale agriculture but also give consumers more control over the food they consume, she wrote.</span><br><span>_____________________</span><br><span>* The personal names in the text refer to the authors of written contributions to the online debate</span>",

            "title": "The Benefits of Being Bilingual",
            "passage": "<span><strong>A</strong></span><br><span>According to the latest figures, the majority of the world&rsquo;s population is now bilingual or multilingual, having grown up speaking two or more languages. In the past, such children were considered to be at a disadvantage compared with their monolingual peers. Over the past few decades, however, technological advances have allowed researchers to look more deeply at how bilingualism interacts with and changes the cognitive and neurological systems, thereby identifying several clear benefits of being bilingual.</span><br><span><strong>B</strong></span><br><span>Research shows that when a bilingual person uses one language, the other is active at the same time. When we hear a word, we don&rsquo;t hear the entire word all at once: the sounds arrive in sequential order. Long before the word is finished, the brain&rsquo;s language system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear &lsquo;can&rsquo;, you will likely activate words like &lsquo;candy&rsquo; and &lsquo;candle&rsquo; as well, at least during the earlier stages of word recognition. For bilingual people, this activation is not limited to a single language; auditory input activates corresponding words regardless of the language to which they belong. Some of the most compelling evidence for this phenomenon, called &lsquo;language co-activation&rsquo;, comes from studying eye movements. A Russian-English bilingual asked to &lsquo;pick up a marker&rsquo; from a set of objects would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn&rsquo;t know Russian, because the Russian word for &lsquo;stamp&rsquo;,&nbsp;<em>marka</em>, sounds like the English word he or she heard, &lsquo;marker&rsquo;. In cases like this, language co-activation occurs because what the listener hears could map onto words in either language.</span><br><span><strong>C</strong></span><br><span>Having to deal with this persistent linguistic competition can result in difficulties, however. For instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly, and can increase &lsquo;tip-of-the-tongue states&rsquo;, when you can almost, but not quite, bring a word to mind. As a result, the constant juggling of two languages creates a need to control how much a person accesses a language at any given time. For this reason, bilingual people often perform better on tasks that require conflict management. In the classic Stroop Task, people see a word and are asked to name the colour of the word&rsquo;s font. When the colour and the word match (i.e., the word &lsquo;red&rsquo; printed in red), people correctly name the colour more quickly than when the colour and the word don&rsquo;t match (i.e., the word &lsquo;red&rsquo; printed in blue). This occurs because the word itself (&lsquo;red&rsquo;) and its font colour (blue) conflict. Bilingual people often excel at tasks such as this, which top into the ability to ignore competing perceptual information and focus on the relevant aspects of the input. Bilinguals are also better at switching between two tasks; for example, when bilinguals have to switch from categorizing objects by colour (red or green) to categorizing them by shape (circle or triangle), they do so more quickly than monolingual people, reflecting better cognitive control when having to make rapid changes of strategy.</span><br><span><strong>D</strong></span><br><span>It also seems that the neurological roots of the bilingual advantage extend to brain areas more traditionally associated with sensory processing. When monolingual and bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening background noise, they show highly similar brain stem responses. When researchers play the same sound to both groups in the presence of background noise, however, the bilingual listeners&rsquo; neural response is considerably larger, reflecting better encoding of the sound&rsquo;s fundamental frequency, a feature of sound closely related to pitch perception.</span><br><span><strong>E</strong></span><br><span>Such improvements in cognitive and sensory processing may help a bilingual person to process information in the environment, and help explain why bilingual adults acquire a third language better than monolingual adults master a second language. This advantage may be rooted in the skill of focussing on information about the new language while reducing interference from the languages they already know.</span><br><span><strong>F</strong></span><br><span>Research also indicates that bilingual experience may help to keep the cognitive mechanisms sharp by recruiting alternate brain networks to compensate for those that become damaged during aging. Older bilinguals enjoy improved memory relative to monolingual people, which can lead to real-world health benefits. In a study of over 200 patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, a degenerative brain disease, bilingual patients reported showing initial symptoms of the disease an average of five years later than monolingual patients. In a follow-up study, researchers compared the brains of bilingual and monolingual patients matched on the severity of Alzheimer&rsquo;s symptoms. Surprisingly, the bilinguals&rsquo; brains had more physical signs of disease than their monolingual counterparts, even though their outward behaviour and abilities were the same. If the brain is an engine, bilingualism may help it to go farther on the same amount of fuel.</span><br><span><strong>G</strong></span><br><span>Furthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to start very early. In one study, researchers taught seven-month-old babies growing up in monolingual or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a puppet appeared on one side of a screen. Halfway through the study, the puppet began appearing on the opposite side of the screen. In order to get a reward, the infants had to adjust the rule they&rsquo;d learned; only the bilingual babies were able to successfully learn the new rule. This suggests that for very young children, as well as for older people, navigating a multilingual environment imparts advantages that transfer far beyond language.</span>",

This term refers to Vilcabamba, the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invaders in the 1530s. Bingham made desperate attempts to prove this belief for nearly 40 years. Sadly, his vision of the site as both the beginning and end of the Inca civilisation, while a magnificent one, is inaccurate.

An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past few years is that Machu Picchu was a&nbsp;<em>moya</em>, a country estate built by an Inca emperor to escape the cold winters of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy monumental architecture and spectacular views. Furthermore, the particular architecture of Machu Picchu suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the Incas, the emperor Pachacuti (c. 1438-71). By custom, Pachacuti&rsquo;s descendants built other similar estates for their own use, and so Machu Picchu would have been abandoned after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish Conquest.</span>"
