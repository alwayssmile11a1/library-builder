            "title": "Research using twins",
            "passage": "<span>To biomedical researchers all over the world, twins offer a precious opportunity to untangle the influence of genes and the environment &ndash; of nature and nurture. Because identical twins come from a single fertilized egg that splits into two, they share virtually the same genetic code. Any differences between them -one twin having younger looking skin, for example &ndash; must be due to environmental factors such as less time spent in the sun.</span><br><span>Alternatively, by comparing the experiences of identical twins with those of fraternal twins, who come from separate eggs and share on average half their DNA, researchers can quantify the extent to which our genes affect our lives. If identical twins are more similar to each other with respect to an ailment than fraternal twins are, then vulnerability to the disease must be rooted at least in part in heredity.</span><br><span>These two lines of research &ndash; studying the differences between identical twins to pinpoint the influence of environment, and comparing identical twins with fraternal ones to measure the role of inheritance &ndash; have been crucial to understanding the interplay of nature and nurture in determining our personalities, behavior, and vulnerability to disease.</span><br><span>The idea of using twins to measure the influence of heredity dates back to 1875, when the English scientist Francis Galton first suggested the approach (and coined the phrase &lsquo;nature and nurture&rsquo;). But twin studies took a surprising twist in the 1980s, with the arrival of studies into identical twins who had been separated at birth and reunited as adults. Over two decades 137 sets of twins eventually visited Thomas Bouchard&rsquo;s lab in what became known as the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. Numerous tests were carried out on the twins, and they were each asked more than 15,000 questions.</span><br><span>Bouchard and his colleagues used this mountain of data to identify how far twins were affected by their genetic makeup. The key to their approach was a statistical concept called heritability. in broad terms, the heritability of a trait measures the extent to which differences among members of a population can be explained by differences in their genetics. And wherever Bouchard and other scientists looked, it seemed, they found the invisible hand of genetic influence helping to shape our lives.</span><br><span>Lately, however, twin studies have helped lead scientists to a radical new conclusion: that nature and nurture are not the only elemental forces at work. According to a recent field called epigenetics, there is a third factor also in play, one that in some cases serves as a bridge between the environment and our genes, and in others operates on its own to shape who we are.</span><br><span>Epigenetic processes are chemical reactions tied to neither nature nor nurture but representing what researchers have called a &lsquo;third component&rsquo;. These reactions influence how our genetic code is expressed: how each gene is strengthened or weakened, even turned on or off, to build our bones, brains and all the other parts of our bodies.</span><br><span>If you think of our DNA as an immense piano keyboard and our genes as the keys &ndash; each key symbolizing a segment of DNA responsible for a particular note, or trait, and all the keys combining to make us who we are &ndash; then epigenetic processes determine when and how each key can be struck, changing the tune being played.</span><br><span>One way the study of epigenetics is revolutionizing our understanding of biology is by revealing a mechanism by which the environment directly impacts on genes. Studies of animals, for example, have shown that when a rat experiences stress during pregnancy, it can cause epigenetic changes in a fetus that lead to behavioral problems as the rodent grows up. Other epigenetic processes appear to occur randomly, while others are normal, such as those that guide embryonic cells as they become heart, brain, or liver cells, for example.</span><br><span>Geneticist Danielle Reed has worked with many twins over the years and thought deeply about what twin studies have taught us. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very clear when you look at twins that much of what they share is hardwired,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;Many things about them are absolutely the same and unalterable. But it&rsquo;s also clear, when you get to know them, that other things about them are different. Epigenetics is the origin of a lot of those differences, in my view.&rsquo;</span><br><span>Reed credits Thomas Bouchard&rsquo;s work for today&rsquo;s surge in twin studies. &lsquo;He was the trailblazer,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;We forget that 50 years ago things like heart disease were thought to be caused entirely by lifestyle. Schizophrenia was thought to be due to poor mothering. Twin studies have allowed us to be more reflective about what people are actually born with and what&rsquo;s caused by experience.&rsquo;</span><br><span>Having said that, Reed adds, the latest work in epigenetics promises to take our understanding even further. &lsquo;What I like to say is that nature writes some things in pencil and some things in pen,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;Things written in pen you can&rsquo;t change. That&rsquo;s DNA. But things written in pencil you can. That&rsquo;s epigenetics. Now that we&rsquo;re actually able to look at the DNA and see where the pencil writings are, it&rsquo;s sort of a whole new world.&rsquo;</span>",

            "title": "An Introduction to Film Sound",
            "passage": "<span>Though we might think of film as an essentially visual experience, we really cannot afford to underestimate the importance of film sound. A meaningful sound track is often as complicated as the image on the screen, and is ultimately just as much the responsibility of the director. The entire sound track consists of three essential ingredients: the human voice, sound effects and music. These three tracks must be mixed and balanced so as to produce the necessary emphases which in turn create desired effects. Topics which essentially refer to the three previously mentioned tracks are discussed below. They include dialogue, synchronous and asynchronous sound effects, and music.</span><br><span>Let us start with dialogue. As is the case with stage drama, dialogue serves to tell the story and expresses feelings and motivations of characters as well. Often with film characterization the audience perceives little or no difference between the character and the actor. Thus, for example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is the character Sam Spade; film personality and life personality seem to merge. Perhaps this is because the very texture of a performer&rsquo;s voice supplies an element of character.</span><br><span>When voice textures fit the performer&rsquo;s physiognomy and gestures, a whole and very realistic persona emerges. The viewer sees not an actor working at his craft, but another human being struggling with life. It is interesting to note that how dialogue is used and the very amount of dialogue used varies widely among films. For example, in the highly successful science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue was evident, and most of it was banal and of little intrinsic interest. In this way the film-maker was able to portray what Thomas Sobochack and Vivian Sobochack call, in&nbsp;<em>An Introduction to Film</em>, the &lsquo;inadequacy of human responses when compared with the magnificent technology created by man and the visual beauties of the universe&rsquo;.</span><br><span>The comedy&nbsp;<em>Bringing Up Baby</em>, on the other hand, presents practically non-stop dialogue delivered at breakneck speed. This use of dialogue underscores not only the dizzy quality of the character played by Katherine Hepburn, but also the absurdity of the film itself and thus its humor. The audience is bounced from gag to gag and conversation to conversation; there is no time for audience reflection. The audience is caught up in a whirlwind of activity in simply managing to follow the plot. This film presents pure escapism &ndash; largely due to its frenetic dialogue.</span><br><span>Synchronous sound effects are those sounds which are synchronized or matched with what is viewed. For example, if the film portrays a character playing the piano, the sounds of the piano are projected. Synchronous sounds contribute to the realism of film and also help to create a particular atmosphere. For example, the &lsquo;click&rsquo; of a door being opened may simply serve to convince the audience that the image portrayed is real, and the audience may only subconsciously note the expected sound. However, if the &lsquo;click&rsquo; of an opening door is part of an ominous action such as a burglary, the sound mixer may call attention to the &lsquo;click&rsquo; with an increase in volume; this helps to engage the audience in a moment of suspense.</span><br><span>Asynchronous sound effects, on the other hand, are not matched with a visible source of the sound on screen. Such sounds are included so as to provide an appropriate emotional nuance, and they may also add to the realism of the film. For example, a film-maker might opt to include the background sound of an ambulance&rsquo;s siren while the foreground sound and image portrays an arguing couple. The asynchronous ambulance siren underscores the psychic injury incurred in the argument; at the same time the noise of the siren adds to the realism of the film by acknowledging the film&rsquo;s city setting.</span><br><span>We are probably all familiar with background music in films, which has become so ubiquitous as to be noticeable in its absence. We are aware that it is used to add emotion and rhythm. Usually not meant to be noticeable, it often provides a tone or an emotional attitude toward the story and /or the characters depicted. In addition, background music often foreshadows a change in mood. For example, dissonant music may be used in film to indicate an approaching (but not yet visible) menace or disaster.</span><br><span>Background music may aid viewer understanding by linking scenes. For example, a particular musical theme associated with an individual character or situation may be repeated at various points in a film in order to remind the audience of salient motifs or ideas.</span><br><span>Film sound comprises conventions and innovations. We have come to expect an acceleration of music during car chases and creaky doors in horror films. Yet, it is important to note as well that sound is often brilliantly conceived. The effects of sound are often largely subtle and often are noted by only our subconscious minds. We need to foster an awareness of film sound as well as film space so as to truly appreciate an art form that sprang to life during the twentieth century &ndash; the modern film.</span>",

Mind you, a very particular kind of nothing: the nothing that stands in the empty slot in the middle.
